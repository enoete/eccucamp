    "## üîç St. Kitts & Nevis Flag Debugging Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "### üêõ Bug Hunt Checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìê Triangle Problems (Bugs 1-4):\n",
    "- **Hint 1**: Triangles should meet at the CENTER of the flag, not 1/3 of the way\n",
    "- **Hint 2**: Check your triangle coordinates - do they reach all the way to the edges?\n",
    "- **Hint 3**: Green triangles should be: upper-left AND lower-right\n",
    "- **Hint 4**: Red triangles should be: upper-right AND lower-left\n",
    "- **Try**: Change `flag_width//3` to `flag_width//2` and fix the coordinate patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üñ§ Diagonal Band Problems (Bugs 5-6):\n",
    "- **Hint 5**: The band is HUGE! Try `band_width = 80` instead of 200\n",
    "- **Hint 6**: Diagonal should go from bottom-left `(0, flag_height)` to top-right `(flag_width, 0)`\n",
    "- **Current bug**: It's going from top-left to bottom-right - completely backwards!\n",
    "- **Try**: Swap your coordinates to fix the diagonal direction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üíõ Yellow Stripe Problems (Bugs 7-8):\n",
    "- **Hint 7**: Stripes are too thick! Try `stripe_width = 15` instead of 50\n",
    "- **Hint 8**: Negative coordinates `(0, -offset)` go off the canvas!\n",
    "- **Hint 9**: If you fix the diagonal direction, the stripe coordinates will need to match\n",
    "- **Try**: Follow the same diagonal pattern as the corrected black band\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚≠ê Star Position Problems (Bug 9):\n",
    "- **Hint 10**: Stars should sit ON the diagonal black band, not floating randomly\n",
    "- **Hint 11**: If diagonal goes from `(0, height)` to `(width, 0)`, calculate points along that line\n",
    "- **Try**: For a point 30% along the diagonal: `x = 0.3 * width`, `y = height - (0.3 * height)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Debugging Strategy:\n",
    "1. **Fix triangles first** - comment out band/stripes/stars and get triangles right\n",
    "2. **Fix diagonal direction** - get the black band going the right way  \n",
    "3. **Adjust band thickness** - make it look proportional\n",
    "4. **Fix yellow stripes** - make them follow the corrected diagonal\n",
    "5. **Position stars correctly** - calculate along the diagonal line\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Success Check:\n",
    "Your flag is correct when:\n",
    "- [ ] **Four colored triangles** meet at the center and fill the entire flag\n",
    "- [ ] **No white background** shows except for stars\n",
    "- [ ] **Diagonal runs** from bottom-left to top-right  \n",
    "- [ ] **Black band** is reasonably thick (not huge, not tiny)\n",
    "- [ ] **Yellow stripes** border the black band properly\n",
    "- [ ] **Two stars** sit on the black diagonal band\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Pro Tips:\n",
    "- **Print coordinates** to debug: `print(f\"Triangle points: {green_triangle_1}\")`\n",
    "- **Test one element** at a time by commenting out others\n",
    "- **Look at the real flag** online for reference\n",
    "- **Don't worry** if it takes several attempts - debugging is a skill!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: Every bug you find makes you a stronger programmer! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí™\n",

    "## üîç Debugging Hints - Antigua & Barbuda Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're having trouble finding the bugs, here are some hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üé® Color Issues:\n",
    "- **Hint 1**: Check if the blue matches Caribbean waters\n",
    "- **Research**: Look up the official Antigua & Barbuda flag colors\n",
    "- **Try**: A lighter, more tropical blue like `(0, 114, 178)` or `(52, 152, 219)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìê Shape & Proportion Problems:\n",
    "- **Hint 2**: Where should the triangles meet? Top and bottom halves?\n",
    "- **Hint 3**: How thick should the black band be? Too thin? Too thick?\n",
    "- **Try**: The band should be prominent but not overwhelming\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚òÄÔ∏è Sun Symbol Issues:\n",
    "- **Hint 4**: Is the sun big enough to be the focal point?\n",
    "- **Hint 5**: How many rays should a sun have? 4 seems too few...\n",
    "- **Hint 6**: Should all rays point outward equally, or is this a \"rising\" sun?\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ Drawing Order Problems:\n",
    "- **Hint 7**: What gets drawn on top of what? Should the sun be visible through the band?\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßÆ Mathematical Bugs:\n",
    "- **Hint 8**: Check your coordinate calculations - are triangles meeting properly?\n",
    "- **Hint 9**: Are ray calculations correct for a sun symbol?\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Debugging Strategy:\n",
    "1. **Compare with reference**: Look up the real Antigua & Barbuda flag\n",
    "2. **Test one element**: Comment out parts to isolate issues\n",
    "3. **Check proportions**: Does each section take the right amount of space?\n",
    "4. **Color accuracy**: Do the colors match the official design?\n",
    "5. **Symbol completeness**: Does the sun look like a proper rising sun?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Success Criteria:\n",
    "Your flag is correct when:\n",
    "- [ ] **Colors match** the official Antigua & Barbuda flag\n",
    "- [ ] **Triangles properly divide** the flag into top and bottom halves\n",
    "- [ ] **Black band** is the right thickness and prominence\n",
    "- [ ] **Sun symbol** is appropriately sized and detailed\n",
    "- [ ] **Sun rays** represent a proper rising sun\n",
    "- [ ] **Overall proportions** look balanced and official\n",
